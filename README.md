# SmartThings Edge Driver for Leviton VRCS2-MRZ (Beta)

Edge Driver implements the Leviton VRCS2 device as a group of 2 on/off switches controlled by corresponding buttons on the VRCS2 device. Using SmartThings allows you to configure routines to integrate each switch to control other SmartThings devices.
The VRCS2 is an older device and discontinued by Leviton. 
* Dashboard displays the state of Switch 1.
